## Description 
#### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) time series listing confirmed cases, reported deaths and reported recoveries. Data is disaggregated by country (and sometimes subregion). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the [Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2) and has had a worldwide effect. On March 11 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases of the Coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world at the time.

- First of all data fetched from site will be converted into the tables.
- Then I have cleaned and normalized that data, for example tidying dates and consolidating several files into normalized time series. We have also added some metadata such as column descriptions.
- In this report I have analysed covid-19 data as Confirmed, Recovered, Active along with deaths.
- This report also contains [Recovery Rate](https://ijmsweb.com/covid-19-recovery-rate-and-its-association-with-development/) & [Fatality Rate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fatality%20rate#:~:text=Medical%20Definition-,fatality%20rate,deaths%20from%20a%20specific%20cause)
- With the help of this project we can get Different meaningful insights countrywise.
- In this project I have used [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/) for visualization of data.

## MS Power BI DashBoard
#### There are 5 types of data visuals As follows:-
- [Card](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-card?tabs=powerbi-desktop) Visuals showing the Confirmed, Active, Recovered cases and deaths along with [Recovery Rate](https://ijmsweb.com/covid-19-recovery-rate-and-its-association-with-development/) & [Fatality Rate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fatality%20rate#:~:text=Medical%20Definition-,fatality%20rate,deaths%20from%20a%20specific%20cause)
- [Search](shorturl.at/hpNT7) Visuals gives control to search desired countrywise data.
- [Table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-calculated-tables) Visual showing the confirmed, recovered, active cases and deaths by country.
- [Stacked column Chart](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/power-bi-stacked-bar-chart/) Visual showing the data countrywise.
- [Country Map](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-map-tips-and-tricks) Visual shows density of cases using the bubbles.
